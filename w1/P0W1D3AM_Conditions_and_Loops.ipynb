        "Here, the body of the loop is executed ten times. The variable i assumes the value 1 on the first iteration, 2 on the second, and so on. This sort of for loop is used in the languages BASIC, Algol, and Pascal.\n",

        "**Three-Expression Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another form of for loop popularized by the C programming language contains three parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- An initialization\n",
        "- An expression specifying an ending condition\n",
        "- An action to be performed at the end of each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "This type of has the following form:\n",

        "for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++)\n",
        "    <loop body>\n",

        "- Continue looping as long as i <= 10.\n",
        "- Increment i by 1 after each loop iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Three-expression for loops are popular because the expressions specified for the three parts can be nearly anything, so this has quite a bit more flexibility than the simpler numeric range form shown above. These for loops are also featured in the C++, Java, PHP, and Perl languages.\n",
