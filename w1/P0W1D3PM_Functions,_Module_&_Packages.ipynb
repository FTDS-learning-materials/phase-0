        "* The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.\n",
        "* The code block within every function starts with a colon (`:`) and is indented.\n",
        "* The statement return `[expression]` exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.\n",

        "\n",
        "Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on **one relatively small portion of the problem**. If youâ€™re working on a single module, youâ€™ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Maintainability**: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. **(You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.)** This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reusability**: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. **This eliminates the need to recreate duplicate code.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scoping**: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps **avoid collisions** between identifiers in different areas of a program."

        "\n",
        "Package management is so important that `pip` has been included with the Python installer since versions 3.4 for Python 3 and 2.7.9 for Python 2, and itâ€™s used by many Python projects, which makes it an essential tool for every Pythonista.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of a package manager might be familiar to you if you are coming from other languages. JavaScript uses `npm` for package management, Ruby uses `gem`, and .NET use `NuGet`. In Python, `pip` has become the standard package manager.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python installer installs `pip`, so it should be ready for you to use, unless you installed an old version of Python. You can verify that `pip` is available by running the following command in your console:\n",

        "As you become a more experienced Pythonista, thereâ€™ll be a set of packages that youâ€™ll know by heart and that youâ€™ll use in most of your applications. The requests and pytest packages are good candidates to become useful tools in your Python toolbox.\n",
        "\n",
        "There will be times though when you will need to solve a different problem, and you will want to look for a different tool or library that can help you with it. As you can see above, `pip` help shows that there is a search command that looks for packages published to PyPI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Letâ€™s see how this command can help us:\n",
        "\n",
        "`pip help search`\n",
        "\n",
        "The command takes a set of options listed above and a `<query>`. The query is just a string to search for and will match packages and their descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Letâ€™s say your application needs to access a service that is using OAuth2 for authorization. Ideally, there is a library that works with requests or with a similar interface that can help us. Letâ€™s search PyPI for it using pip:\n",
        "\n",
        "`pip search requests oauth`\n",
        "\n",
        "The search term yields quite an extensive collection of packages. Some of them seem specific to a service or technology like django-oauth. Others look promising, like requests-oauth. Unfortunately, there isnâ€™t much information other than a brief description.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the time, you want to search for packages directly in the PyPI website. PyPI provides search capabilities for its index and a way to filter results by the metadata exposed in the package, like framework, topic, development status, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "A search for the same terms in PyPI yields a lot of results, but you can filter them by different categories. For example, you can expand the Intended Audience and select Developers since you want a library that helps you with developing your application. Also, you probably want a package that is stable and production-ready. You can expand the Development Status category and select Production/Stable:\n",

        "Finding the original source code repository can be an invaluable resource. There, you can find some hints about the status of the project by looking at the date of the latest commits, number of pull request and open issues, and so forth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another option to find a package is to Google it. Widely used Python libraries will show up at the top of google searches, and you should be able to find a link to the package in PyPI or its source code repository.\n",

        "\n",
