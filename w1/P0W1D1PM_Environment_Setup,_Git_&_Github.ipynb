        "\n",
        "**Shell** is the command interpretor in an operating system such as Unix or GNU/Linux, it is a program that executes other programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bash** is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the ' Bourne-Again SHell ', a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh , which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary of Basic Commands:\n",
        "- `echo` is a command to write a text or string, example: `echo \"Hello hacktiv8\"` . If you want to add text to the file : `echo \"Hello, my name is sardi\" >> name.txt` .\n",
        "- `pwd` is a command to find the path of the directory (folder) you are currently using.\n",
        "- `cd` to call a directory or path.\n",
        "example: `cd /home/username/sardi/hacktiv8` . If you want to move to the root directory, you can type the command: `cd ~`. If you want to go to the parent directory of hacktiv8 by typing: `cd ..` , then you will be in the path `/home/username/sardi/` .\n",
        "- `ls` is the basic command used to view the contents of a directory.\n",
        "- `cp` used to copy files from one directory to a different directory. Example: `cp /home/user/sardi/sardi.txt /home/user/sardi/hacktiv8` .\n",
        "- `mv` is a command to move files and can also be used to change or rename files. Example : `mv sardi.txt /home/user/hacktiv8` .\n",
        "If you want to rename the file, you can use the command: `mv sardi.txt sardi2.txt` .\n",
        "- `mkdir` is the command that works to create a new directory. example: `mkdir name_directory`\n",
        "- `rm` is the basic command to delete a directory and its contents. If you only want to delete the directory, you can use the command: `rmdir` atau `rm -r`.\n",
        "- `cat` is used to read files or create new files. for example to read a file: `cat sardi.txt` . If you want to create a new file, you can use the command: `cat > newfile.txt` ,then write the text that will be filled and then press CTRL + C to close the command.\n",
        "- `vim` is the command that works to create files and fill in text. for example, write `vim nama_file.txt` in the terminal then fill in the text then press the keyboard button `Esc` then type `:wq` to write and save changes then exit, `:q!` stop and destroy the changes made, `:q` exit if no changes.\n",
        "- `grep` is a command to search all texts in a given file, example: `grep query namefile.txt` . the query here is the word or text that will be searched in `namefile.txt`. we can use `\"-i\"` to ignore case sensitive. Example : `grep -i 'hello hacktiv8' file.txt` ,then all `hello hacktiv8` words that use upper or lowercase letters will appear. If you want to add line numbers, use `\"-n\"` , example: `grep -n query file.txt` .\n",
        "- `wget` is a command to download files from the internet. example: `wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip` . If you want to save with a different name, use `\"-O\"`, example : `wget -O wordpressku.zip https://wordpress.org/latest.zip`. We can also use \"-P\" to save in another directory `wget -P documents/myDirectory/ https://wordpress.org/latest.zip` .\n",
        "-`zip, unzip` to compress files to zip archive and unzip command to extract zip files to zip archive, for example we want to archive a folder named \"Documents\" in a zip file named \"doc.zip\", then we can run the command `zip -r doc.zip Documents`.\n",
        "- `awk` is a scripting language used to manipulate data and generate records.\n",
        " - Using awk to print lines containing a specific word in a file: `awk '/irfan/ {print}' employee.txt` , every line that contains the word `irfan` to be printed. For more details, see the following picture:\n",

        "\n",
        " - Splitting a Line Into Fields: For each record i.e. a line, the awk command divides the records delimited by a space character by default and stores them in a variable `$n`. If the line has 3 words, it will be stored in `$1`, `$2` dan `$3`. while, `$0` represents the whole line. Look at the following picture:\n",

        "\n",
        "- `sed` is stands for stream editor and can perform many functions on files like search, replace, delete etc. the `sed` command is generally applied to replace the contents in a file.\n",
